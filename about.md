## About

We are a tiny team of developers that like to build stuff that works and is
built with simplicity in mind.

Our primary goal is to help businesses, start-ups and indie developers who are
just starting out and every basic tool out there in the market costs a lot more
than they can afford.

We make all kinds of things but if there's a specific software / service you
wish we made, you can get in touch with us on <contact@tinytown.studio>
